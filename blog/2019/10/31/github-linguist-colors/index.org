I was looking at Github Linguist's color [[https://github.github.io/linguist/][page]] today, trying to see which
languages are /leaning/ towards purple. Think Haskell, Emacs Lisp, Julia etc. But
since their sorting order is utterly worthless[fn::Of course it is not meant for
that.] for this task, here is a better view of all the languages on the HSL
scale.

The plot's only use is to reverse lookup languages by color shades using
pan/zoom around the scatters. I don't think any kind of semantic cluster pops
here as these colors are essentially random (also notice the space coverage).

As an aside, I thought purescript's was the darkest color I have seen, but I
have seen wasm, shen and crystal and never noticed that theirs are, at least, as
dark as purescript.

/Data note/: Color data comes from [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/linguist/8cad89ea5b64a26c87278d6e53cbc37bfd7cd177/lib/linguist/languages.yml][this file]] in the linguist repository. While
processing, I removed items without a ~color~ key. Total languages are
