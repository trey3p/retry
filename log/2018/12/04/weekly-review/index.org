* Experiments

* Readings/Explorations
- Read up [[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/][PEP 544 -- Protocols]]. Might be useful since we are starting to use
  type hints at many places now, though only for documentation and not safety.
- Did some reading on fonts since there were rendering issues with /complex
  scripts/ based languages in Emacs.

* Programming

- I have started doing [[http://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]] this year too. Will be keeping the
  solutions [[http://github.com/lepisma/advent-of-code][here]]. Will be trying a few new languages from my list [[pile:wiki:programming/languages][here]].
