* Experiments

* Readings/Explorations
- A few pieces from Morning Paper
  - [[https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/11/30/lemna-explaining-deep-learning-based-security-applications/][LEMNA: explaining deep learning based security applications]]
  - [[https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/11/19/scootr-scaling-r-dataframes-on-dataflow-systems/][ScootR: scaling R dataframes on dataflow systems]].
- Julia [[https://julialang.org/blog/2018/12/ml-language-compiler][looks lucrative]] again. They have few really nice language level ideas.

* Programming
#+HTML: <figure> <div id="commit-plot"></div> <figcaption>
Commits for week 49-2018 and 4 previous weeks. [fn::Looks like commit counting
is a little buggy since it updates a lot for past weeks]
#+HTML: </figcaption></figure>

- Nothing significant, except a few advent-of-code problems and work stuff.

* Writing

* Media
- A few more issues from Sandman.
- Also started [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33509756-moral-fables-followed-by-thoughts][Moral Fables]].
- Having a bit more travel time these days, I went through a bunch of podcasts.
  Specially started looking into [[https://www.thisamericanlife.org/663/how-i-read-it][TAL]] and [[http://www.backstoryradio.org/shows/flu][BackStory]]. Also [[http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/oliver-sacks-journey-where-to-where/][this piece]] on Oliver
  Sacks by Radiolab.
