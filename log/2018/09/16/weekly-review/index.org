First [[file:../../14/weekly-reviews/index.org][weekly review]]. Will be very incomplete and mostly biased towards the
weekend since I started logging items in these last couple of days.

* Problems/Solutions
- Nothing. This is bad. There should be major items here.

* Readings/Explorations
- Skimmed [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.html][asdf]] documentation. It's really extensible and I bet you can handle
  mixed language projects in this too.
- Went through a survey on active learning cite:aggarwal2014active.
- Got into two threads of readings which I will be continuing
  - Data programming (the machine learning type) and
  - Entity resolution

* Programming
- Overall nothing major, [[https://github.com/lepisma/duck.el][wrote]] [[https://github.com/lepisma/pypi][little]] [[https://github.com/lepisma/obtt][bits]] of elisp.
- Planned to improve [[https://github.com/lepisma/bbq][bbq]] so that it does entity resolution and breakpoint
  detection based clustering of items but fell into the asdf rabbit hole.

* Writing
- Started the wiki page on [[pile:wiki:programming/language-composition][Language Composition]].

* Media
- Finally finished [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194441.Tales_of_Old_Japan][Tales of Old Japan]].
- Listened a bit about [[https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/what-are-think-tanks-all-about.htm][think tanks]], I had no idea how properly (formally?) they
  are used.
