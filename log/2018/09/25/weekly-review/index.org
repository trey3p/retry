#+TITLE: Weekly Review /38-2018/
#+SETUPFILE: ../../../../../assets/export.setup

I will be doing reviews on Mondays now to save the weekend work time. This week
was pretty dilute. I wasn't getting large chunks of time so wasn't able to do
any heavy lifting.

* Problems/Solutions
- Touched a little upon techniques to beat the leader in a online learning-ish
  resource allocation problem. Will be doing a short journal post in near
  future.

* Readings/Explorations
- Kauffman's paper (cite:kauffman1991coevolution) on Coevolution to the edge of
  chaos.

* Programming
- Started working on a transpiler for Lisp to Python, [[https://github.com/lepisma/pigeon][pigeon]].
- Played around a little with [[https://github.com/cffi/cffi][cffi]] in Lisp. Its so much nicer than you might
  think.

* Writing
- Nothing major, organized the paper reading process and set up a better
  structure for my [[pile:wiki:readings/notes/documents][notes page]].

* Media
- Read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1280983.True_Names][True Names]].
- Radiolab's [[http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/infective-heredity/][Infective Heredity]]. This reminds me, they are really good with
  sound effects.
- [[https://youarenotsosmart.com/2018/09/11/yanss-134-the-elaboration-likelihood-model/][Elaboration Likelihood Model]] on You Are Not So Smart.
