#+TITLE: Weekly Review /41-2018/
#+SETUPFILE: ../../../../../assets/export.setup

This week was mostly spent in readings and stuff. I also was stuck with flu for
the later half so wasn't able to do anything else.

* Problems/Solutions
- Nothing.

* Readings/Explorations
- Read up a few introductory documents on Ontologies.
- I am trying to understand /learnable/ parsing so took up Combinatory Categorial
  Grammar (cite:steedman1996very)
- How NOT to evaluate your dialog system (cite:liu2016not)
- Strange loop 2018 had few interesting ideas. I liked [[https://github.com/lexi-lambda/hackett][hackett]]. This makes me
  wonder what exactly typed racket doing? Definitely something simpler.
- Got to use [[https://lparallel.org/][lparallel]]. Working with single threading for so long almost had me
  squeal at this.
- Also used [[https://github.com/construct/construct][construct]] which is a composable way for going back and forth from
  bytes to python objects.
- Finally read up on functional package management and tried [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/index.html#Top][guix]]. Needs a
  little momentum but looks really promising. I am specially interested in
  things like ~guix environment~ and dependencies which go cross distro painlessly
  (though these are not the direct output, they are nice side effects).

* Programming
- Added a few new features/syntaxes in [[https://github.com/lepisma/pigeon][pigeon]]. Will abuse reader macros for some
  time now.
- A few other pieces I don't have logs of. Will be putting the commit visualizer
  here from next week onwards.

* Writing
- Nothing.

* Media
- Better Science through Art (cite:gabriel2010better)
- Resumed Sandman. Finished [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25101.Season_of_Mists][Season of Mists]].
- [[https://plus.maths.org/content/uncoiling-spiral-maths-and-hallucinations][Uncoiling the spiral: Maths and hallucinations | plus.maths.org]]
