One of the things I have learned from these past weeks is that /only/ weekends are
not going to work out. Things that are fresh in memory should stay there
consistently for a while.

* Problems/Solutions
- Nothing. I /should/ be pushing things in weekday gaps now too.

* Readings/Explorations
- Read the [[https://www.amazon.com/Little-MLer-Matthias-Felleisen/dp/026256114X][The Little MLer]].
- Made some progress in [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/326790.The_Society_of_Mind][The Society of Mind]].
- Read up a few things on semantic parsing.
- Starting on [[https://www.amazon.com/Syntactic-Structures-Noam-Chomsky/dp/1614278040][Syntactic Structures]].

* Programming
- Did a few things in [[https://github.com/lepisma/pigeon][pigeon]] and am adding features incrementally on a need
  basis so that I can port a few of the python scripts that I use.

* Writing
- Nothing major.

* Media
- [[https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-ranked-choice-voting-works.htm][Ranked Choice Voting]]
