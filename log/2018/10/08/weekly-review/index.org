#+TITLE: Weekly Review /40-2018/
#+SETUPFILE: ../../../../../assets/export.setup

After around 4 reviews, I believe I have a better sense of where my time is
going. I feel I am now reading more /effectively/ and am also prioritizing the
programming tasks better. The problem is in the parts where I need to /think/
about and /design/ solutions to problems, outside the work time. Will be working
on that this week.
 
* Problems/Solutions
- Nothing.

* Readings/Explorations
- Made some more progress in [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/326790.The_Society_of_Mind][Society of Mind]]. Something about its writing style
  is slowing me down.
- Bringing ML and compositional semantics together (cite:liang2015bringing)
- [[https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html][Design Principles Behind Smalltalk]] by Ingalls.
- Swoosh: A generic approach to entity resolution (cite:benjelloun2009swoosh)

* Programming
I am trying to automate parts of this section so it shows some measure of
/intensity/ and /amount/ of work I did last week including the work time.

- Spent (wasted) some time getting Haskell FFI to work. Pretty easy to call in
  C, but gets a little hairy with Python when depending on other libraries.
- Came across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/comments/9bh8u6/introducing_seed_an_interactive_software][seed]], guess it's pretty close to the idea of Smalltalk's
  interactive programming /environment/. I should try some system like this since
  it looks really good for recreational programming.
- Cleaned up my [[https://github.com/lepisma/cfg][cfg]] files a little, will sweep [[https://github.com/lepisma/rogue][rogue]] some time too.
- Explored Haskell a little.

* Writing
- Nothing specific. Though I have noticed, writing reviews has made it easier to
  put together tiny journal posts every now and then.
