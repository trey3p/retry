Another busy work week.

* Problems/Solutions
- Nothing.

* Readings/Explorations
- [[https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2018/all-the-languages-together.html][All the Languages Together]] from Strange Loop. Main idea is to use type
  preserving compilation and to define certain properties as linking types
  across languages.

- State-of-the-art speech recognition with sequence-to-sequence models (cite:chiu2018state)

Changed the design of [[https://github.com/lepisma/pigeon][pigeon]] to fallback to python syntax when needed. This
along with possibility to use lisp syntax in between feels like a much more
practical way to go forward than to try and support every arbitrary python
feature. Consider, for example, decorators like the following (assume ~@{~ is the
python code indicator):

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
@{@decorator}
(defun something () ...)
#+END_SRC

* Writings
