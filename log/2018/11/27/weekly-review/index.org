#+TITLE: Weekly Review /47-2018/
#+SETUPFILE: ../../../../../assets/export.setup

I missed two reviews. This one might not have correctly demarcated items. Also
redefining the sections a little so they make more sense.

* Experiments
/This section is for logging experiments connected with a problem I am solving.
The output can be programs, documents etc./

- NA

* Readings/Explorations
/The title is self explanatory/
- [[https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/11/14/adasearch/][AdaSearch: A Successive Elimination Approach to Adaptive Search]], not really
  sure this is something new. I feel a lot of similar ideas are around, covering
  different instantiations/variations of the narrowing search problem.
- Found [[http://blinkdb.org/][BlinkDB]] (as a result of finding this nice blog, [[https://blog.acolyer.org/][the morning paper]]), have
  to see how it works but surely looks interesting.
- [[http://esoteric.codes/blog/evan-buswell][Evan Buswell - esoteric.codes]]. Don't think the idea is as fundamental as
  posed. I might be wrong since it needs a bit of growth to really show the
  colors.
- [[https://twobithistory.org/2018/11/12/cat.html][The Source History of Cat]] from two bit history (they have some really
  interesting pieces).
- Came to know that there is a fuzziness feature allowed in regex packages (see
  [[https://pypi.org/project/regex/][here]] for example). I wonder whether a weighted regex, using a weighted
  automata is useful enough to warrant existence.

* Programming
/Mostly for recreational programming. Though the plot covers all commits,
including work related./

- I got to setup elfeed finally. My feeds are [[https://github.com/lepisma/rogue/blob/master/feeds.org][here]].
- Wrote some /inconsequential elisp/ (these two words should be kept together).

* Writing
/General writings, not related to experiments/

- Tried to factor up the idea of Strange Loop and wrote a bunch. As an aside,
  writing on paper feels real good.

* Media
/Books, podcasts, essays etc./

- Read a few books. [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition][The Little Schemer]], [[https://www.amazon.com/Probably-Approximately-Correct-Algorithms-Prospering/dp/0465032710][Probably Approximately Correct]] and a few
  more issues from [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40372-the-sandman][Sandman]].
- Came to know about [[https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/what-were-war-masks.htm][war masks]]. Try out a few image searches for 'war masks
  ww1', pretty neat.
- A few essays. [[https://aeon.co/essays/deny-and-become-the-radical-ethos-of-negative-capability][Deny and become: the radical ethos of negative capability]], [[https://aeon.co/essays/why-read-the-nihilistic-work-of-giacomo-leopardi-today][Why
  read the nihilistic work of Giacomo Leopardi today?]] I also tried curio on
  aeon, the narration was nice.
