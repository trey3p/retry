* Experiments

* Readings/Explorations
- Morphnet: fast & simple resource-constrained structure learning of deep
  networks (cite:gordon2018morphnet)
- [[https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/06/03/ease-ml-ci/][Continuous integration of machine learning models with ease.ml/ci]]. It would
  have been a better contribution if the code was open (I am not able to find it
  on their [[https://github.com/DS3Lab][lab's github]]) and the project was ready to use, since similar ideas
  are tried by almost every ML practitioner.
- A bunch of Clojure stuff. [[https://github.com/clojure/core.typed][Types]], [[https://github.com/clojure/test.check][testing]], [[https://github.com/clojure/core.async][concurrency]]. Also I feel like
  cookbooks (like Clojure's) make a /lot/ of sense when the audience is not a
  beginner programmer.
- Model-based testing without models: the todomvc case study
  (cite:bainczyk2017model)
- [[https://kdenlive.org/en/2019/03/inside-kdenlive-how-to-fuzz-a-complex-gui-application/][Inside Kdenlive: How to fuzz a complex GUI application?]]
- I am looking into testing methodologies for complex UIs and found a nice path
  where you learn an fsm-ish model of the system's behaviour and then,
  essentially, fuzz it. [[https://github.com/LearnLib/learnlib][learnlib]] does that.
