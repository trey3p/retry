* Experiments

* Readings/Explorations
- Networks and history (cite:bearman2002networks)
- Parallelizing wfst speech decoders (cite:mendis2016parallelizing)
- [[https://ericabrahamsen.net/tech/2016/feb/bbdb-eieio-object-oriented-elisp.html][BBDB on EIEIO â€“ An Introduction to Object-Oriented Emacs Lisp]]. Okay I thought
  EIEIO is a very low powered CLOS but I was wrong about the feature sets.
- [[https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/06/07/data_aug/][1000x Faster Data Augmentation]] and [[https://deepmind.com/blog/population-based-training-neural-networks/][Population based training of neural

* Media
- [[https://aeon.co/essays/knowledge-is-a-stone-age-concept-were-better-off-without-it][Knowledge is a stone-age concept, we're better off without it]]. This is really
  interesting, even though I feel author is /favoring/ true positives without
  probably considering if that really is important. The interesting thing is
  that this provides a lot of thought food for understanding the way we think
  about aims of machine intelligence in general.
- [[https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-tv-ratings-work.htm][How TV Ratings Work]]. I came to know the pervasiveness of Nielsen while reading
  /Cultural Logic of Computation/ but here were a few more pieces that I didn't
  know about, specially sweeps week and the audio fingerprinting tech used for
  spying on shows.
