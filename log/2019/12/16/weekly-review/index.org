* Experiments
Nothing again. I need to start avoiding a lot of managerial drudgery in work. I
think there are a few steps I should start taking:

1. Enforce hours and smaller time spans for meetings not related to actual ML
   work.
2. Start using simpler tasks management systems wherever needed. I don't mind
   sticky notes at this moment to be honest. JIRA can fuck right off. Real world
   project management is so much bike shedding.
3. Another process eating my time is hiring. I probably should start automating
   loads of that by structuring the evaluation methodologies.

Seeking perfection in organizational tasks is doomed to screw my real directions
of work.
