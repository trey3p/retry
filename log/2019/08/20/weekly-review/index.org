A bunch of missed reviews. Putting only last week stuff for now.

* Experiments
- Wasn't able to make any progress on dialog veneering work. Mostly not moving
  my legs to tag data.
- Spent some time modeling the play logs from my music player to setup a thumbs
  up-down type recommendation system.

* Readings/Explorations
- Finished [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month][The Mythical Man-Month]].
- A really nice and popular [[https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/][guidebook on ML]] that I was unaware of.
- Reflections on trusting trust (cite:thompson1984reflections)
- [[http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2016/10/practical-advice-for-analysis-of-large.html][Practical advice for analysis of large, complex data sets]]. I didn't quite get
  hooked into many things here. Mostly tells that I am not working with large
  data sets. Or, more likely, I am not looking at things in the right way.
- I have been exploring a few project management tools. Things like [[https://github.com/taskjuggler/TaskJuggler][taskjuggler]]
  look impressive and worth spending some time on. Starting with basic effort
  and time estimation in org mode itself (try [[https://github.com/rksm/clj-org-analyzer][rksm/clj-org-analyzer]]) though.

* Media
- [[https://aeon.co/essays/why-do-we-allow-objects-to-become-tainted-by-chance-links][Why do we allow objects to become tainted by chance links?]]
- [[http://earth.nautil.us/article/429/the-strange-blissfulness-of-storms][Earth on Nautilus: The Strange Blissfulness of Storms]]. Feel pretty biased even
  after considering that results are not clear. Probably adding confounding
  factors in the last paragraph would have helped. Also basic arguments like
  /why do I feel similar when I imagine a storm?/ should be cared for before
  putting one liners.
- Finished [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71252.The_Kindly_Ones][The Kindly Ones (The Sandman, #9) by Neil Gaiman]]. This one was really
  nice. I now like the series much more than earlier when, while coming from
  Watchmen, I was looking for something to impress me very early on.
- I have started trying out curio (probably the trial is up by now though) and
  it looks really nice. Being shorter than podcasts and more user driven helps.
  Found a few new sources here. Specially The Idler. Here are a few shorts that
  I liked:
  - [[https://play.curio.io/track/7OInJPAQNsaUgx3yn0VgoN][The cure for workaholism is philosophy]]
  - [[https://play.curio.io/track/1jE33IZRVcrswXuGdu7Cy9][Why apps will never save the world]]
