* Media
- [[https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/sysk-selects-whats-the-deal-with-crop-circles.htm][SYSK Selects: What's the Deal with Crop Circles?]] This reminds me of a book I
  had with all these /unsolved/ mysteries. I found that pretty interesting when I
  was younger. Don't really understand why I don't think any of them had any
  truth, even without being explicitly told about the farce in each.
