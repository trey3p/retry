* Experiments
- As a /mid term goal/, I am working on having better understanding of
  conversations and how to rewrite them without changing the underlying
  grounding. There are some interesting ideas here related to incoherent
  conversations that i will be continuing with further. Probably also a few blog
  posts.

* Readings/Explorations
- Got to know about [[https://tabnine.com/][TabNine]]. Nice that someone is doing justice to this idea. I
  might now switch for prose, unless that also happens.
- Read up [[http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~billmann/dialogue/dmt.htm][Dialog Macrogame Theory]]. Nice idea but there sure are limits.
- Made more progress in /On Growth and Form/. Keeping notes [[pile:wiki:readings/notes/books/on-growth-and-form][here]].
