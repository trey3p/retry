* Experiments
- Continued with explorations of dialogue related problems that can potentially
  turn out to be hard or interesting. A few updates are [[pile:journal:2019/07/20/dialog-veneering][here]]. Works in /dialogue
  alignment/ have nice threads to follow.

* Readings/Explorations
- Probing neural network comprehension of natural language arguments
  (cite:niven2019probing).
- Alignment in dialogue (cite:garrod2007alignment).
- Statistical user simulation with a hidden agenda
  (cite:schatzmann2007statistical).
- Collaborative Multi-Agent Dialogue Model Training Via Reinforcement Learning
  (cite:papangelis2019collaborative).

* Programming

- Finished porting my player to lisp completely. Onto more important things now.

* Media
- [[https://www.zedbooks.net/blog/posts/free-time-pressures-employability-refusal-work/][Refusal of Work: Free Time and the Pressures of Employability]]. Among other
  things, I got a nice take on education's purpose here, which is to /enable
  enjoyment of life's more complex pleasures/.
-  [[https://aeon.co/essays/what-can-schrodingers-cat-say-about-3d-printers-on-mars][What can Schrödinger’s cat say about 3D printers on Mars?]] Not a lot of new
  information but I like the way of differentiating the words /life/ (lineage of
  functional information) and /alive/ (things that maintain themselves).
