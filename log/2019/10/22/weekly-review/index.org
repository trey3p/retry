I skipped last week and don't remember which things I covered in last vs this
week so will not add much in this page.

* Experiments
- I have been thinking a little about interactive fiction and seeing if I can
  incorporate ideas from it in my writings. This also goes back to something I
  hinted some time back [[pile:journal:2019/08/03/conflicting-posts][in journal]]. I found [[https://www.amazon.com/Cybertext-Perspectives-Literature-Espen-Aarseth/dp/0801855799][a book]] on the topic so will be
  continuing with that before giving this thread a set of actionables.

* Readings/Explorations
- [[https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/10/19/empathy-and-subjective-experience-in-programming-languages/][Empathy and subjective experience in programming languages]]
- Found a nice library [[https://github.com/andrewrk/libsoundio][libsoundio]] for working with audio devices.

* Programming

* Media
- Finished [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer][Neuromancer]].
- Finished [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42683.Ernest_Hemingway_on_Writing][Ernest Hemingway on Writing]].
- [[https://aeon.co/ideas/do-we-possess-our-possessions-or-do-they-possess-us][Do we possess our possessions or do they possess us? | Aeon Ideas]]. I feel that
  essentialism is pretty common and drives a lot of what we all do. A lot of
  arguments about /true value/ of entities that I have had with many of my
  acquaintances miss out on this piece as if this is /obviously/ not involved
  (irrational!) even when it is /obviously/ involved.
