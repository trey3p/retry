* Experiments
- I am moving to a more longer scale, semester like personal cycle. Each cycle
  is of 3-4 months and is pretty similar to OKRs. I am seeing a few positive
  changes in what I am /able/ to do now but since there are other confounding
  factors, I won't say anything very clear at the moment.
- Gave a rough try to speaker embeddings from [[https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning][Real-Time-Voice-Cloning]] models for
  a tiny internal dataset. Even though the accents are pretty different (US
  trained, tested on Indian English), the embeddings are pretty informative and
  useful.
- I am trying to see how useful I really can make speech/acoustics as a mode of
  interacting with my machine(s). I have a live list [[pile:wiki:interfaces/acoustic][here]].

* Programming

Commits for week 40-2019 and 4 previous weeks.

Little less than usual commit counts is an interesting thing to notice. These
last couple of weeks had me doing the sort of programming I like rather than
what I am forced to do usually. For earlier weeks, I believe I was still doing
regular stuff but just a little less.

#+begin_quote
In a world which could not be grasped as a whole, and where there were no
universally shared values, most people clung to the particular niche to which
they were most committed: their job or profession. They treated their work as a
post-religious calling, ‘an absolute end in itself’, and if the modern ‘ethic’
or ‘spirit’ had an ultimate foundation, this was it.
