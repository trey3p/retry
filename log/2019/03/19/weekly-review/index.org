* Experiments

* Readings/Explorations
- Growing a Language (cite:steele1999growing)
- Rapidly building domain-specific entity-centric language models using semantic
  web knowledge sources (cite:akbacak2014rapidly)
- Streaming end-to-end speech recognition for mobile devices
  (cite:he2018streaming)
- Dynamically typed languages (cite:tratt2009dynamically)
- [[https://petewarden.com/2016/05/03/how-to-quantize-neural-networks-with-tensorflow/][How to Quantize Neural Networks with TensorFlow Â« Pete Warden's blog]]. There
  are a lot of cool things happening on the runtime side of neural nets.
- [[https://learnyousomeerlang.com/dialyzer][Type Specifications and Erlang | Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!]]. A
  first glance at /success typing/ feels like just your regular optional typing.
  But probably there is a difference. Will be looking into the paper
  cite:lindahl2006practical.

* Programming

- Studied CL's restarts and conditions. Probably they are most useful when you
  don't really know the error modes or they too many to fix programmatically in
  a general way; I feel I have a few uses for them in [[https://github.com/lepisma/bbq][bbq]]. Will be looking into
  signals in some time to understand how they are implemented.
- Started using Clojure at work, hopefully we will have a good run with it.
