Missed a bunch of these reviews so will refrain from being elaborate this time.
I am also starting to add a timestamp in every capture from now on so I can
clearly say which things happened in /last/ week and which earlier.

* Experiments
+ I have been thinking about a more programmer friendly API for
  [[https://github.com/lepisma/emacs-speech-input/][emacs-speech-input]] as I don't really like the boring FSM-ish conversational
  framework. Looking at the whole process as a probabilistic parser running on
  audio streams can work out. Plus you, probably, get to design flows using
  something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator][parser combinators]].

* Readings/Explorations
- A few readings on speaker diarization and connected topics
  - Speaker diarization with lstm (cite:wang2018speaker)
  - Fully Supervised Speaker Diarization (cite:zhang2018fully)
  - Utterance-level Aggregation for Speaker Recognition in the Wild (cite:xie2019utterance)
- [[https://twobithistory.org/2019/11/06/doom-bsp.html][How Much of a Genius-Level Move Was Using Binary Space Partitioning in Doom?]] A
  post from two-bit history after a long time.

* Programming

* Media
- Finished [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40372-the-sandman][Sandman]].
- [[https://www.thisamericanlife.org/687/small-things-considered][Small Things Considered - This American Life]]
- [[http://wakingup.libsyn.com/164-cause-effect][Making Sense with Sam Harris: #164 â€” Cause & Effect]]. I have been meaning to
  dive in Pearl's ideas but haven't really gotten time. This specific episode
  wasn't that helpful in that sense.
