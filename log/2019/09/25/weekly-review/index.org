I am trying out a longer term (3-4 month) planning methodology which might
affect the way I look at weekly reviews, specially /Experiments/ section which
stays quiet on a shorter scale. Will have some thoughts next week.

* Experiments

* Readings/Explorations
- Mixing dirichlet topic models and word embeddings to make lda2vec
  (cite:moody2016mixing).
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-TLSBdHe1A][Performance matters]].
- A little bit on [[https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/expcardconversationconfirmation/][user]] [[https://agileforall.com/new-to-agile-invest-in-good-user-stories/][stories]].
- A really exciting [[https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317][Quantum Supremacy update]].
