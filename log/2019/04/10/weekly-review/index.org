* Experiments
- Took something from my lists and wrote a post after a long time. [[https://lepisma.xyz/2019/04/09/blurring-text/][Blurring
  Text]]. Will be trying to do such things on a regular basis.

* Readings/Explorations
- Blinkdb: queries with bounded errors and bounded response times on very large
  data (cite:agarwal2013blinkdb)
- Went through a few subword papers:
  - Bpemb: tokenization-free pre-trained subword embeddings in 275 languages
    (cite:heinzerling2017bpemb)
  - Sentencepiece: a simple and language independent subword tokenizer and
    detokenizer for neural text processing (cite:kudo2018sentencepiece)
