* Media
- [[http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22453145/tendulkar-country][In Tendulkar country | ESPNcricinfo.com]]. This was a nice read. I guess I have
  missed out a lot of long reads about Cricket from cricinfo.
- [[https://aeon.co/ideas/muhammad-an-anticlerical-hero-of-the-european-enlightenment][Muhammad: an anticlerical hero of the European Enlightenment]]. I have been
  reading things related to Muhammad recently and it's surprising to find a lot
  of rich stories/views behind.
- [[https://aeon.co/ideas/why-hasnt-evolution-dealt-with-the-inefficiency-of-ageing][Why hasnâ€™t evolution dealt with the inefficiency of ageing?]]. Medawar's theory
  basically.
- [[https://aeon.co/ideas/a-constitution-should-help-a-country-govern-not-hobble-it][A constitution should help a country govern, not hobble it]]. Not sure what
  should I take away from here other than constitutions should be pretty
  situated and flexible, which is probably obvious.
