* Experiments
- Spent some time documenting and formalizing few of the ideas related to
  strange loop and program modeling that will go in the wiki.

* Readings/Explorations
- Developing production-level conversational interfaces with shallow semantic
  parsing (cite:raghuvanshi2018developing)
- The causes of evolvability and their evolution (cite:payne2018causes)
- A recent discussion regarding [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/a9z8h0/first_class_macros/][first Class Macros]] led me to fexpressions and
  the Kernel language. Will be exploring further in coming weeks.
- [[https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-01-25-futhark-module-system.html][The Futhark Module System]]. Now I see the point of ML's modules. I had read
  about those in The Little MLer but didn't really see what they were trying to
  solve.

  looks interesting.
